Browser-side React app. A diary of films watched, including watch date. Sorting and flitering the diary supported.

Limited functionality and future fixes: Currently can only add films from a JSON file containing 30 films, which is tentatively stored browser-side until server-side is implemented. The Favorites footer, as well as drag-and-drop feature from diary to favorites not yet implemented.

App can be iniated with NodeJS with the following commands:

npm init

npm run build

serve -s build
